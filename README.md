## Background
Developing games is one the best ways to learn programming. Google's codelab [Introduction to ARCore in Unity](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-intro/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) is a testament to that when it comes to designing and developing for augmented reality. Sadly, the exercise is no longer maintained and there are bugs which can be hard to overcome for someone new to Unity. This project is an upgraded version of the project and introduces a better architecture, UI enhancements and other game elements to make it a production ready AR app which anyone with an [ARCore compatible device](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) can install and enjoy. Further, the project is completely open-source for AR enthusiats to learn the ropes and become a proficient AR developer. :v:
